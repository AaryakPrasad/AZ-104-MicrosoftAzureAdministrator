# Lab Scenario Preview - 05 - Implement Intersite Connectivity
## Lab scenario
Contoso has its data centers in Boston, New York, and Seattle offices connected via mesh wide-area network links, with full connectivity between them. You need to implement a lab environment that will reflect the topology of Contoso's on-premises networks and verify its functionality.

## Objectives
In this lab, you will:
+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Configure local and global virtual network peering
+ Task 3: Test intersite connectivity
